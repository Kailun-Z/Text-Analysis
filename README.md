# Text-Analysis
By this practice, I am able to demonstrate:

- an ability to work with text data and extract them from various sources of written communication such as documents and social media (e.g., Twitter).
- an ability to construct appropriate data structures for further analysis.
- an ability to conduct unsupervised (topic modeling, sentiment analysis) and supervised (predictive modeling) learning on text data.
- basic conceptual understanding of language models and their applications.
